# Create functions add, subtract, multiply, and divide in the calculator.py module.
# Import the calculator module into a separate Python script main.py and use its functions to perform arithmetic operations on numbers like 5 and 3.
# Exercise 2: Exploring Python Libraries

# Instruction:

# Use the requests library to fetch weather information from an online weather API (e.g., weatherapi.
# Install the requests library using pip if itâ€™s not already installed pip install requests.
